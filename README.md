# hello-world
My repo for learning how to use GitHub.

I have been using R for 6-8 years, but I am new to formal version control practicies. I have primarily used GitHub to download existing code from other people and occasionally to share my (nearly complete) code.

I hope I learn this quickly and find it useful. :smile:
